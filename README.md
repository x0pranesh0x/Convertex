# Convertex
## A Simple to use Currency Converter




## Features

- Convert between currencies
- get bar/line graphs of historical data from 2018-06-01 to current date
- live rates of currencies

## How to Run

- Simple, Open the index.html file, thats it
- reqiures internet connection 

**Note:**

-in the case study it was mentioned live data is needed from anywhere between 5 seconds to 24 hours, most of the api's that i've found required me to pay a huge amount of money to subscribe so that I can retrive live data from their api. Instead, I opted for an open source api which gives live data every one hour.
I hope that will suffice :)
